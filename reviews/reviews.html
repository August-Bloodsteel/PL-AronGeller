            <h1>
                In 2016, I got from friends that in Indonesia there is a person who can do a lot and speaks Russian perfectly.</h1>

                <h2> <span id="sip">    Soon my assistant flew to him, met with him, and I ordered him to build a 220 m2 villa and offered only 3D visualization, I did not attach any working documentation. We signed a contract with him and I sent him a bank card, where I sent money from time to time for the next stage of construction. I must say for the first time I meet a builder who refuses to accept payment in advance. It was hard to believe, but the reviews of my friends had weight. Aron built everything exactly but not only. Later, a lot of things were found at the villa, which was not mentioned at all, but the estimates did not increase. But not only the estimate has not grown, but on the contrary – for the rest of the money he built another gazebo and made many pleasant trifles, transitions, tracks, and so on. I have never seen Aron Geller live, but what he did amazes me. Today the villa surrenders and is never empty. Soon I am going to the island of Bali where I finally see the person who does the impossible. <br>
                    I wish him good luck and success. </span> </h2>

                Aron Geller is the only person in my life who, in some way, during the dialogue launches my thoughts in my head, this feature first met in communication with a person.</h1>

                <h2> <span id="sip2">  Such a man in Bali is only one – Aron, of those whom I have seen. His value is that any of his endeavours have always been successful and Aron is able to do well and adapt his knowledge and skills in Indonesia, which he showed over 10 years there. Just my observations. In the presence of own funds and / or external investments, I will always be happy to work with Aron first and foremost, despite the fact that he is a perfectionist, striving for the best for ideal realization is always better than anyhow. But only personally, no remote (communication at a distance) and the Internet. </span></h2>

                I was asked to write a review. I will write as it is. I will try without ratings. He is very complicated. He is machine.</h1>

                <h2> <span id="sip3">I do not know when he sleeps. Harsh but very well-mannered – he’s hanging in there. Sometimes he loses control and the voice is harsh, but he has a point. We must have to try harder to get him out of control. Very stubborn. This can be understood – under his charge more than 60 people at the site and production. Everyone speaks Indonesian, he is fluent in a language and a couple of dialects. Speaks fluently in 5 or 6 languages. Teaches one more. I didn’t believe it — I saw it and only then made sure — a fanatic of study. Bossing everybody but everyone respects. He lives on a construction site, this is his element, he is a king and a god there. At the site, everyone flies, whether he’s here or not. I came several times unexpectedly when he was gone – people at me, zero attention, are all passionate about their work. The job based on a military type – he was born in the family of an employee of special forces and has a genetically developed discipline. Hates hack and lazy – expel and does not look <br> back. Locals call the type of man-stone (Solid). <br>
                    As for the money – jeweler. Add his own, but will not ask the customer. <br>
                    Particularly I was shocked how he attitude to his wife – it must be seen. Need to learn. A lot of things. Complicated in communication, but he makes a real product, you will cannot find fault. Will not drinking with you and will not chatting in vain. Busy says. <br>
                    Conclusion. Order and go, do not bother. Will be ready – come and live. <br> <br>
                    
                    I have never seen people like him before. Thanks. </span></h2>

                <h2> <span id="sip4">I was client of mr. Aron Geller and his construction company in 2015 so we start to build my project in 2014 December and fully completed in 2015 November. Well what should I say. It was great experience. I tired to find honest construction company and almost disappointed but one of my German friends told me that mr Aron Geller could help me to build a villa of my dream. So he did that. He makes me happy because until now I have no any trouble in a villa. He was architector, engeneer, constructor even designer moreover even decorator. He can better than designer because mr Aron Geller understand how to use all materials to make it cheaper. He always care everything about. He save my money. <br>
                    Also, few words . A person who does not speak much; also, a person of action rather than words. His job is so stressful but personally he’s very friendly and very politely guy. He respect your time, respect your money, respect your dreams and believe me, your dreams will come true. <br>
                    God Bless You mr Aron Geller. </span></h2>
