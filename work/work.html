                       <p> Our extensive experience with design-build projects allows us to create value and flexibility, which in turn <br> creates savings for our clients in both time and costs. As a general contractor using design-build delivery <br> systems, we have a unique background in preconstruction that most contractors don’t normally possess.<br> </p>

                       <p> We have an extensive amount of experience in design reviews, constructability analysis, scheduling, <br>coordination, and value engineering in all construction types and building systems. With experience on more <br> than 20 design- build projects, we have learned to work closely<br>
                        with owners and end users to create value, flexibility, and time savings in the preconstruction phase. <br></p>
                        
                        <p>Communication is the key to any successful relationship and before we do any heavy lifting, we work hard to <br> ensure a smooth process at every stage of a project. Designs are reviewed and discussed to confirm that the <br> client is getting the best value.<br>
                        Our Project Executives and Project Managers are adept at identifying issues early in the process before they <br> become costly changes down the road. Our Estimators will create and refine the program budget. Project <br> Managers work hand in hand with Estimators to make adjustments as needed. <br></p>
                        
                        <p> Our team is creative and innovative in searching for solutions and alternatives for value engineering ideas. And <br> as creative builders, we are always searching for time and cost-efficient alternatives. <br></p></h2>
